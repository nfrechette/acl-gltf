# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in the ACL glTF toolset! All contributions that follow our guidelines below and abide by our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) are welcome.

In this document you will find relevant reading material, what contributions we are looking for, and what we are *not* looking for.

# Getting set up

See the [development setup](./docs/development_setup.md) section for details on how to generate project solutions, build, and run the unit tests.

Every pull request should trigger continuous integration on every platform we support and they will also execute the unit tests automatically.

The project roadmap for the next few milestones is tracked with [GitHub issues](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl-gltf/issues). [Backlog issues](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl-gltf/milestone/1) are things I would like to get done eventually but that have not been prioritized yet.

Whether you create an issue or a pull request, I will do my best to comment or reply within 48 hours.

# Contributions we are looking for

Several issues already have a [help wanted](https://github.com/nfrechette/acl-gltf/labels/help%20wanted) label. Those tasks should be either reasonably simple or tasks that I do not think I will get the chance to get to very soon.

Feature requests are welcome providing that they fit within the project scope. For smaller features, you are welcome to create an issue with as much relevant information as you can. If it makes sense, I will prioritize it or add it to the backlog, and if I feel it is beyond the scope of the project, I will tell you why and close the issue.

# Contributions we are *not* looking for

A lot of older compilers do not properly support **C++11** and there is no plan to support them. 

If you aren't sure, don't be afraid to reach out by email!
